 Ex5-SupervisedLearning
 Support Vector Machines
 ===============================
 
 
The Matlab folder contains the solutions to the whole exercise, each part is documented in provided matlab files
 
Executing Ex05Solution.m produces the expected results including plots;
 
Example output:

      Results
      - training set: npos = 124, nneg = 143
      - validate set: npos = 76, nneg = 57
      - tp = 73 (96.1%)
      - fp = 3 (5.26%)
      - fn = 3 (3.95%)
      - tn = 54 (94.7%)
      - accuracy = 0.9549, errorrate = 0.04511
      - tprate = 0.9605, fprate = 0.05263
      - precision = 0.9605, recall = 0.9605
      - fmeasure = 1.921

      
By playing with the values of C, p, sigma, kernel; you can get to see the behaviour of the classifier
