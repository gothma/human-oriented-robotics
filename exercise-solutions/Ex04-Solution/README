 Ex4-SupervisedLearning
 Naive Bayes Classifier
 ===============================
 
 
The Matlab folder contains the solutions to the whole exercise, each part is documented in the two
Matlab files classifynaivebayes.m and Ex04Solution.m
 
Executing Ex04Solution.m produces the expected results;
 
Example output:
